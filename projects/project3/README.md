For this project, I initially wanted to play with object detection because I'm interested in technology as a sort of magic- the quote "Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" comes to mind.

For many people, programming is mysterious and not well understood. Though they know logically it isn’t “magical”, it might as well be, and many people fall into superstition or magical thinking when it comes to technology, for example verbally asking the computer to please work, or believing photo editors can do things like make a person in a photo turn around. I initially wanted to use tarot card recognition to play on this theme, of magic and technology.

I ran into technical difficulties but this was still quite useful, and I pivoted to circle detection (which didn’t require training new classifiers), hoping to create a “magical” experience using that instead. Whether or not the circle detection is exactly accurate is not the point, rather the idea is to “read” the image in an unexpected way, creating music out of visual data. Each circle is detected, then translated to a musical note, with the note being based on the circumference of the circle.
