The myth of Sisyphus is about a man who must push a boulder up a hill forever. We remember his punishment well. However, what many forget is his crime; Sisyphus was deceitful, greedy, and a murderer of innocent travellers and guests. He took pleasure in killing. It would be difficult to argue that Sisyphus didn’t deserve punishment. But did he deserve this specific punishment? What about a gentler one? And can any crime truly merit eternal, infinite anguish?

In this interactive webtoy, you can take the role of a god and decide for yourself. Tilt your phone one way (phone held horizontally with the top to the left) and you can help Sisyphus by letting him move down the hill, tilting the ground to ease his progress. Flip your phone the other way (top of the phone to the right) and Sisyphus is once again forced to climb the hill, except now you have the power to change its incline at a whim and torture him for all eternity. Or, in either scenario, hold your phone completely horizontally to give him a break.

After a few minutes, inevitably, the player asks: okay, cool, but what is the point? When does it end? The answer is it doesn’t have one, and it never ends. Even gods get bored. The looping day and night cycle marks the passage of time without any clear ending, and the jailer is doomed to the same infinitely pointless existence as the prisoner. To free yourself, you must close your phone and thus, free Sisyphus as well.
