With Youtube Storytime, I attempt to take the procedural nature of children's Youtube videos and translate it to a storytime format to experiment with the strangeness that comes out of it. Not all of my results are disturbing, and in fact most are not, but it should be noted that this is also the case on Youtube; the vast majority of offerings for preschoolers is simply mediocre, not strange enough to scare parents but so low-quality and incoherent few would deliberately chose it as entertainment for their child. I point this out not to downplay the negative possibilities of genuinely scary or offensive content but to clarify the situation.

It might seem lazy to claim I am aiming for this mediocrity, but what fascinates me about these videos and about machine-generated content in general is the scarcity of these scary, strange, or incredible outliers. Because humans are what we are, the possibility of finding meaning in gibberish is exciting and almost magical.
